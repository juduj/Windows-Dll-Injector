# Windows-Dll-Injector
This was something I coded up awhile ago. 
I was digging around my old repos and found this, I use it sometimes because its on my taskbar when I need to inject a dll into something.
I remember the OpenFile functions I used were not actually mine, I re use the same source and header file for any program I need to open files with in c++.
So credits to whoever had that made from where-ever I got that off from.
